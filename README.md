### **doppler.py**

**Description:**
This Python script fetches and displays Doppler radar images for specified locations. It allows users to select a radar location by providing a country code and radar code. The script then retrieves the most recent Doppler radar image for that location from the appropriate source on the internet. The script automatically updates the radar image every 10 minutes and displays it using the mpv media player in the terminal.

**Usage:**
1. Run the script `doppler.py` from the terminal.
2. Input the desired radar location in the format `<Country Code>:<Radar Code>`.
3. The script will fetch and display the Doppler radar image for the selected location.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3
- `curl`
- `mpv`
