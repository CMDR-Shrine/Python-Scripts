This Python script fetches and displays Doppler radar images for specified locations. It allows users to select a radar location by providing a country code and radar code, then fetches the most recent Doppler radar image for that location from the appropriate source on the internet. The script automatically updates the radar image every 10 minutes and displays it using the mpv media player in the terminal.
